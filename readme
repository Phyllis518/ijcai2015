This code is used for the paper "Target-dependent Twitter Sentiment Classification with Rich Automatic Features" (IJCAI2015)

To run the "targetdep+" model:
- Change current directory to folder "ijcai2015/models"
- Type "./run" to:
	+ Automatically extract rich features
	+ Scale features
	+ Learn model
	+ Predict the accuracy.
We only made a simple grid search to tune parameter C, so the testing result only reaches about 70% in accuracy. In order to get the result as in our paper (71%), you need to make a smoother grid search.
